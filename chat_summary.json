The user instructed the AI to add the Hadoken button, which the AI accepted. \n\nNext, the AI offered another checklist that included features like a garbage-themed text style, custom font for themed text, dynamic text color, background animation effect, and text shadow for visibility. The user requested to change the text to a garbage theme, and the AI confirmed it would do so. The AI followed this with another list that included changing the main display image to a garbage-themed graphic, adding a dropdown for favorite video game genres, implementing a rating system, including a section for user reviews, and adding a search bar. The user asked to change the picture to be garbage themed, and the AI acknowledged this request as well. Throughout the conversation, the AI presented questions to the user regarding specific preferences for the Hadoken button action, the visual styling of the button, the type of text for the garbage theme, and the type of garbage imagery for the background.",
